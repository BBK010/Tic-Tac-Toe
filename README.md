This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to Play
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click on any empty cell to make a move.
The game alternates between "X" and "O" for each turn.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all cells are filled and no player has achieved a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.
